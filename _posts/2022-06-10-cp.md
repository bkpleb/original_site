Hey there. This blog posts contains a list of learning resources I've used/use for CP. 

For guided structure of problems: [Aizu Online Judge's Courses](https://onlinejudge.u-aizu.ac.jp/courses/list)

Library of problems: [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/problems), [YOSUPO](https://judge.yosupo.jp/), and [Codeforce's extensive problemset list](https://codeforces.com/problemset?order=BY_SOLVED_DESC)

Also, various national olympiads have their own contest training sites -> [Australian (AIO)](https://orac2.info/hub/) and United States (USACO) [here](https://usaco.guide/) and [here](https://train.usaco.org/)

I've stopped CP this year and just still practice to keep my brain sharp. Do keep in mind that olympiads aren't the end goal but the continuous pursuit of problem solving which will really never end. 
Programming is in fact simple in a nutshell but its various implementations is extremely difficult.

And if you've found a pattern here that I like japanese coding sites, you're absolutely right :p 
Japanese websites are the best (_aesthetics man, aesthetics_) :3
